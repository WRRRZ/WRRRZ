Welcome to WRRRZ are you ready for the ultimate adventure ? 
Mint your interactive Character in form of a #dynamicNFT directly to your Polygon Wallet. 
Your WRRRZ are based on DIASv3D and will evolve over time. If your character dies in the Game 
it dies in the Blockchain and it will turn into a Biography of the Player. Besides a lot of fun,
action and strategic thought you are able to visit Stores and utilise In Game Services, buy Phygital 
Fashion Products and fight your way up the WRRRZ Hierarchy. Chainlink VRF technology allows us to 
create an almost infinite amount of characters that are all entirely unique in traits, performance 
and appearance.

The Rhodium Coin is the main InGame Currency of WRRRZ with it you can mint new WRRRZ, 
buy products and services inside the game and even create real estate in a frequent but 
safe area inside the game where other users can spend their Rhodium. Our Focus is on 
Fashion, Music, Web3 and a digital Nomad Lifestyle so if you have a business that fits 
in that niche feel free to apply for some real estate before the launch. The Rhodium Coin 
is a Stable Coin pegged to Polygon Matic 1:1 it is a burnable token and burns all game fees
and ~7% of the WRRRZ products generated profits.
